# pt2-clone
ProTracker 2 clone for Windows/macOS/Linux

Aims to be a **highly accurate** clone of the classic ProTracker 2.3D Amiga software, with additional audio filters and audio mixer improvements to make it sound close to a real Amiga computer.

# Releases
Windows/macOS binary releases can always be found at [16-bits.org](https://16-bits.org/pt2.php). \
Linux users will unfortunately have to compile the program manually.

# Compiling the code
Please read HOW-TO-COMPILE.txt file in the repository.

PS: The source code is quite hackish and hardcoded. \
My first priority is _accuracy_, not flexibility and clean code.
