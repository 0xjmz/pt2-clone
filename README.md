# pt2-clone
ProTracker 2 clone for Windows/macOS/Linux

Aims to be a **highly accurate** clone of the classic ProTracker 2.3D software for Amiga. \
Has additional audio filters and audio mixer improvements to make it sound close to a real Amiga computer. \
*What is ProTracker? Read about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProTracker).*

# Releases
Windows/macOS binary releases can always be found at [16-bits.org](https://16-bits.org/pt2.php). \
Linux users will unfortunately have to compile the program manually.

# Compiling the code
Please read HOW-TO-COMPILE.txt file in the repository.

PS: The source code is quite hackish and hardcoded. \
My first priority is to make an _accurate_ 1:1 clone, and not to make flexible and easily modifiable code.
